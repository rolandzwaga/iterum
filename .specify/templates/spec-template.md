# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users can complete account creation in under 2 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of users successfully complete primary task on first attempt"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]

## Assumptions & Existing Components *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Before proceeding to planning phase, identify existing codebase
  components that may be relevant to this feature. This prevents ODR violations
  and duplicate implementations per Constitution Principle XIV.
-->

### Assumptions

- [Assumption 1: e.g., "Users have accounts before using this feature"]
- [Assumption 2: e.g., "System has network connectivity"]

### Existing Codebase Components (Principle XIV)

*GATE: Must identify before `/speckit.plan` to prevent ODR violations.*

**Relevant existing components that may be reused or extended:**

| Component | Location | Relevance |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| [e.g., existing Smoother class] | [e.g., dsp_utils.h] | [May conflict / Should reuse / Reference implementation] |

**Initial codebase search for key terms:**

```bash
# Run these searches to identify existing implementations
grep -r "[key term 1]" src/
grep -r "[key term 2]" src/
```

**Search Results Summary**: [Document what was found or "No existing implementations found"]

### Forward Reusability Consideration

*Note for planning phase: When this is a Layer 2+ feature, consider what new code might be reusable by sibling features at the same layer. The `/speckit.plan` phase will analyze this in detail, but early identification helps.*

**Sibling features at same layer** (if known):
- [e.g., Similar feature A that might share code]
- [e.g., Similar feature B that might share code]

**Potential shared components** (preliminary, refined in plan.md):
- [e.g., "MotorController might be useful for BBD mode too"]
- [e.g., "Composition pattern with FeedbackNetwork likely shared"]

## Implementation Verification *(mandatory at completion)*

<!--
  CRITICAL: This section MUST be completed when claiming spec completion.
  Constitution Principle XV: Honest Completion requires explicit verification
  of ALL requirements before claiming "done".

  This section is EMPTY during specification phase and filled during
  implementation phase when /speckit.implement completes.
-->

### Compliance Status

*Fill this table when claiming completion. DO NOT claim completion if ANY requirement is ❌ NOT MET without explicit user approval.*

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| FR-001 | [✅/❌/⚠️/🔄] | [Test name or reason for failure] |
| FR-002 | [✅/❌/⚠️/🔄] | [Test name or reason for failure] |
| SC-001 | [✅/❌/⚠️/🔄] | [Measured value vs target] |
| SC-002 | [✅/❌/⚠️/🔄] | [Measured value vs target] |

**Status Key:**
- ✅ MET: Requirement fully satisfied with test evidence
- ❌ NOT MET: Requirement not satisfied (spec is NOT complete)
- ⚠️ PARTIAL: Partially met with documented gap
- 🔄 DEFERRED: Explicitly moved to future work with user approval

### Completion Checklist

*All items must be checked before claiming completion:*

- [ ] All FR-xxx requirements verified against implementation
- [ ] All SC-xxx success criteria measured and documented
- [ ] No test thresholds relaxed from spec requirements
- [ ] No placeholder values or TODO comments in new code
- [ ] No features quietly removed from scope
- [ ] User would NOT feel cheated by this completion claim

### Honest Assessment

**Overall Status**: [COMPLETE / NOT COMPLETE / PARTIAL]

**If NOT COMPLETE, document gaps:**
- [Gap 1: FR-xxx not met because...]
- [Gap 2: SC-xxx achieves X instead of Y because...]

**Recommendation**: [What needs to happen to achieve completion]
